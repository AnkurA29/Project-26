Steps
Wash and peel the potatoes. Cut into thin fries.

Soak the potatoes in hot water for a few mins until the starch floats above. Then rinse with cold water to remove excess starch. This makes crispy fries. Dry completely on tissues or kitchen towel.

Heat oil on high in a pan and deep fry the fries in small batches until golden colour is achieved and outer part is hardened. Transfer to a plate.

Let oil heat further on medium high flame. Fry the fries once more until it becomes super crispy and golden brown colour.

In an air tight container mix all the spice powders under “peri peri masala” well. Shake to mix well. Can be stored this way for long time and used in all snacks

Sprinkle the peri peri masala powder generously on the fries while hot. Serve with tomato ketchup or enjoy as such.
